        <img src="./assets/images/Dexter.jpg" alt="Dexter"> 
        <p>My name is Dexter Griffith. I am 29 years old, and prouldy Born-and-Raised in a small suburb of Fort Worth called Haltom City. After graduating from Haltom High School, I went on t o attend The University of Texas at Arlington, were I began studying Psychology full time after a few career path swaps. During my time at The University of Texas at Arlington, I joined a collegiate Esports team, and competed in yearly in a Collegiate Esports League, called CSL for short. During this time my passion for video games, and anything involving software began to take off. I finished my degree in Psychology, and work at Parkland Hospital in the Psychiatry Department, as a Mental Health Technician, however it doesnt excite me as much as web development and software development had in the past. Thus, I took the leap! I changed my career, decided to follow my passions and become a web developer.
